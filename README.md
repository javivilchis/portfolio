# The process for achieveing this layout

* Draw your intended layout by sketching on a notepad or a program like adobe xd.
* Once the wireframe is defined, start with your html file.

* Now code.

# Future implementations
* Add a framework that will let me add new projects dynamically.
* Create a scafold to create themes using sass or any other css preprocessor.
* Create a docker file that will generate a vm to be easily portable in any cloud service that use .yaml files.
